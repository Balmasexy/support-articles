<h1>404 When Viewing Org Settings</h1>
<p>If your organization shares a Pricing Plan with a parent org, please confirm that your VCS username is a member of that org. This will ensure you have the proper permissions to view org settings.</p>
<p><strong>Note: It is not recommended for user accounts to share their plan, since user accounts cannot add members.Â </strong></p>
<p>If you run into any issues after verifying org membership, please reach out to our <a href="support.circleci.com" target="_self">Support Team</a>.</p>
