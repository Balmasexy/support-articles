<h1>Exceeding 3MB Max Config Size</h1>
<p>The maximum size of a CircleCI configuration file (config.yml) is 3MB. When this limit is exceeded, customers may see errors such as "<strong>Unexpected exception processing config"</strong> or "<strong>A compiled config YAML must be at most 3MB"</strong> or "<strong><span>Error: Your config (including expanded orbs) is too large. Please contact support."</span></strong> in their build logs.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that this is the <em>compiled</em> configuration. This is the result of expanding any YAML anchors and aliases as well as expanding any included Orbs.<br><br>To find out what is the final or <em>compiled</em> configuration, use the CircleCI CLI <a class="css-bspq7p" title="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#processing-a-config" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/how-to-use-the-circleci-local-cli#processing-a-config" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-renderer-mark="true">to process the original config</a>.</p>
<p>From there, you can inspect the compiled configuration file size using the commands below:<br><br><span class="prismjs css-14r4yet" data-code-lang="shell" data-ds--code--code-block=""></span></p>
