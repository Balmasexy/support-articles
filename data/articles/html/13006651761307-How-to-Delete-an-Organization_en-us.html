<h1>Organization Data Deletion</h1>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Organization deletion effectively deletes all build history, contexts, and project environment variables for a given org. At this time, requests for org deletion can only be completed by filing a Support ticket.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Submitting a Request</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">To submit a deletion request, please open a ticket with our support team via the <a href="https://support.circleci.com/">Support Center.</a> In the ticket, </span>please provide the Organization Name (case-sensitive) and indicate if it is GitHub, Bitbucket, Gitlab, or any combination of the three.</p>
<p><strong>Note: CircleCI will <em>only</em> approve deletion requests made my org admins. Please ensure you have <em>not</em> disconnected your org from CircleCI before submitting a request, otherwise our Support agents will not be able to verify admin status. </strong></p>
<p class="p1">Once the deletion begins processing, it can take up to several hours, depending on the size of the org, for deletion to complete. </p>
<h2 class="p1">After Deletion is Complete</h2>
<p>Upon receiving confirmation from our agents that your organization is deleted, please be sure and log in to your VCS to remove any CircleCI webhooks that remain in your repository settings. This support article describes this process should you need guidance:</p>
