<p>Please note that this guide is for builds on CircleCI Cloud (circleci.com) <strong>only</strong>.</p>
<h1><span>Before We Start</span></h1>
<p>Typically, we are trying to compare two builds from the same project.<br>Let us call them build A and build B, where the following is true:</p>
<ul>
    <li>build A ran before build B.</li>
    <li>both build A and B are creating an image from the same, <strong>unchanged</strong> Dockerfile.</li>
    <li>we are <em>expecting</em> build B to leverage some, if not all, cached layers from build A.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Dockerfile has been modified, this can cause the cache to bust, and result in cache misses.<br>Please refer to Docker documentation on the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/" target="_self">best practices for writing a Dockerfile</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Step 1: Confirm DLC is Enabled</h2>
<p>As a quick check, make sure that you have enabled DLC on your build indeed.<br>Depending on your job's executor, you should have enabled DLC on either <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/docker-layer-caching/#remote-docker-environment" target="_self">the Remote Docker (for Docker executor)</a> or the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/docker-layer-caching/#machine-executor" target="_self">Machine image definition itself (for Machine executor).</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When DLC is enabled, you should be able to see `Restoring DLC` within the build output for the <strong>Spin up environment</strong> step.</p>

<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Step 2: Verify if the Image is saved</h2>
<p>To keep the cache storage optimal, CircleCI <strong>prunes</strong> images at the end of the build, under this DLC Teardown step.<br>Please note that <a href="https://discuss.circleci.com/t/fyi-small-dlc-update-no-action-required/44614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this step is not charged, and does not consume credits on your end</a>.<br><br>As of this writing, CircleCI will prune images in an order to fit the DLC storage limit (currently at <strong>15 GB</strong>).<br><br>You can observe this under the build output of the <strong>DLC Teardown</strong> step.<br><br><img src="https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/15356851975451" alt="Screen_Shot_2023-05-11_at_14.37.18.png"><br><br>If your image is pruned, it is not saved into the DLC cache storage then.</p>
<p>Subsequent builds will thus not be able to leverage DLC for the cached image layers.</p>
<p><br>To verify if your built Docker image was pruned as a result of <strong>DLC Teardown</strong>, we can list up the available Docker images <strong>at the start and end of the job.</strong><br><br></p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 5px;">steps:<br>  # check what images were saved and loaded by DLC from previous runs <br>  - run: |<br>      docker image ls<br>  - checkout<br>  - run: |<br>      docker image build --tag test --file Dockerfile .<br>  # again, check what the built images are<br>  - run: |<br>      docker image ls</pre>
<p><br>This way, we can compare the image IDs against what was pruned under DLC Teardown.<br>We can also verify the size of our built images this way.<br><br><img src="https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/15356944523931" alt="Screen_Shot_2023-05-11_at_14.45.50.png"><br><br></p>
