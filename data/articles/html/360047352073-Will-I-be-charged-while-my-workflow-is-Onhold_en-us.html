<p id="h_01HB9T3K1N35CPF2E22YBYH771">You will not be charged for additional credits while your workflow is "on-hold". </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="h_01HB9TAC8F18ZMBVAVC5JD2QSG">Expected behavior</h2>
<p><strong>Duration timer :</strong> will continue to run while a job is "on hold".</p>
<p><strong>Credits:</strong> Will not be charged for workflows that are in a hold state waiting for manual approval. The hold state doesn't require any resources, therefore no additional credits are consumed while jobs are "on-hold".</p>
<p>More information on credit charges can be found on our <a href="https://circleci.com/pricing/" target="_self">pricing page</a> -- in addition, we have some further <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">details in our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Jobs and steps that ran before the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#type" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval step</a> those jobs would have consumed credits to run. </p>
