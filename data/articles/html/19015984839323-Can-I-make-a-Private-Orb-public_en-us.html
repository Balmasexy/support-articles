<h1>Private Orbs</h1>
<p>Orbs published as private <em>cannot</em> be switched to public. If you've accidentally published an orb as private, the best path forward would be to push the source code as a new public orb. Also, CircleCI does not currently support deleting orbs so you will need to rename the re-published public orb.</p>
