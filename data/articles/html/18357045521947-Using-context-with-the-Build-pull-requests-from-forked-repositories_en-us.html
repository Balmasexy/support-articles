<h1 id="h_01H91QAG65A3J2M9612XQFN53R">Overview</h1>
<p>You may want to use context to share environment variable across projects. However, when you build pull requests from forked repositories, the user who triggered the build often is not a member of the organization that the project is running under in CircleCI. Therefore, you will see an Authorization error in the CircleCI UI and the build will not run.  </p>
<h2 id="h_01H91QAG65DQ5HSDKK4PZBH4RX">Resolutions: </h2>
<h3 id="h_01H91R5FX4WQ9JXD2NV661MQY8">Re-run the failed build</h3>
<p>You can have a user with the correct permission re-run the build. This will use the permissions of the user re-ran the build. Please note that the user still needs to be a member of the assigned security group within the organization. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="h_01H91R5FX43HVAX2XN87Y0TD76">Hold the workflow for manual approval</h3>
<p>You can hold the workflow for manual approval by a user with the correct permissions to the context. This means that workflow will remain on-hold until it is approved. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="h_01H91R5FX4ADAD4VM51XGSD22H">Use project level environment variables</h3>
<p>In order to share environment variables with forked repositories you will need to enable the <em>Pass secrets to builds from forked pull requests</em> feature from your project settings &gt; advanced. </p>
