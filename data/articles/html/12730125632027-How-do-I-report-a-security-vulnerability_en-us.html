<ul class="green-circles no-offset">
    <li>Inform us as soon as possible.</li>
    <li>Test against fake data and accounts, not our users' private data (please ask if you'd like a free account to work on this).</li>
    <li>Work with us to close the vulnerability before disclosing it to others.</li>
</ul>
<p class="bold"><strong>CircleCI does not have a bounty program.</strong></p>
<p>We do not offer bug bounties for discovered vulnerabilities. We hope that if you discover vulnerabilities in the course of your work that you share them with us so we can improve the health of the internet ecosystem.</p>
