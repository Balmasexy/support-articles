<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/docker-layer-caching/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker Layer Caching (DLC)</a> can reduce Docker image build times on CircleCI by caching individual layers of any Docker images built as part of your jobs. DLC is a useful feature, but there is a lot going on behind the scenes. Here are some frequently asked questions concerning DLC that will hopefully help our users understand its expected behavior:</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>Is DLC available between different workflows under the same project?</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">Yes, DLC is not locked to workflows or jobs. You can create a maximum of 50 DLC volumes per project (including any parallelism).</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>Why are subsequent builds not able to access the cache consistently?</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">If a job fails while calling a specific DLC volume, it would require rebuilding when calling it again, causing inconsistencies. It is worth noting that different jobs may also use different volumes. One example would be if two<span> </span><code>machine</code><span> </span>jobs are run in parallel, they <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/docker-layer-caching/#how-dlc-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will get different DLC volumes</a>.</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>How can I delete my DLC cache instance?</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">Utilizing the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/local-cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CircleCI CLI</a> with a version greater than <code>v0.1.24705</code>, you can now delete the DLC cache with the following command:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 5px;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">circleci project dlc purge &lt;vcs-type&gt; &lt;org-name&gt; &lt;project-name&gt; [flags]</pre>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>Is DLC guaranteed? </strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">DLC is not guaranteed. <span>If you are experiencing issues with cache-misses or need high-parallelism, consider trying caching using <code><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#specifying-external-cache-sources">docker build</a></code>, which you can optionally implement using the <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/docker#commands-build">CircleCI Docker orb</a></span>.</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>As an admin, can I see the content of a DLC volume?</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">While you can see what volume is used for each job, at this time, the contents of the cache are unavailable.</p>
